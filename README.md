The purpose of this project is to quantify the amount of infiltration of rain water there is in a particular basin in WADC's sewer system. This is done by pulling data from ADS's data repository using their API, taking daily flow totals from each metering site and performing a mass balance. Due to the topology of the system, it is also necessary to pull data from WADC's High Tide SCADA system using its API to get lift station flow data. All of this data is processed in the python functions included in this repository and stored in an ArcGIS data table and Excel files.
